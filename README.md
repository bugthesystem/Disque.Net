# Disque.Net
A simlpe .Net client for the Disque in-memory distributed queue [https://github.com/antirez/disque](https://github.com/antirez/disque)
> [Disque](https://github.com/antirez/disque) is ongoing experiment to build a distributed, in memory, message broker. Its goal is to capture the essence of the "Redis as a jobs queue" use case, which is usually implemented using blocking list operations, and move it into an ad-hoc, self-contained, scalable, and fault tolerant design, with simple to understand properties and guarantees, but still resembling Redis in terms of simplicity, performances, and implementation as a C non-blocking networked server.
